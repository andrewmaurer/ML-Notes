\subsection{First Class Functions and Closures}
\label{sec:first-class-closure}

Python is said to have \emph{first class functions}, meaning that functions are treated just as any other object. They may be assigned to variables, and they may be returned from functions. Consider the example of Figure \ref{fig:first-class-functions}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
\begin{minted}{python3}
def 
\end{minted}
  \caption{Functions may be assigned to variables, and may be returned as the output of a function.}
  \label{fig:first-class-functions}
\end{figure}
