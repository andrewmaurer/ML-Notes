# ML Notes

Here I have some notes I've taken on various topics in machine learning and related fields. There are four documents:

1. `ideas.pdf`: These are some ideas for new or different ML ideas I've had or I've chatted about with colleagues. Once I'm a bit more comfortable with basics (e.g., using `sklearn`) I'll go ahead and implement them to see if they hold water.

1. `notes.pdf`: needs a better name. This is the heart of this repo, and has pretty extensive notes on machine learning algorithms I'm trying to get more comfortable with. I'll try to mix theoretical with practical, especially regarding advice on increasing usefulness of the model.

1. `python.pdf`: This might actually disappear soon. I want to get better at developing python and I'm not sure if writing up information about python programming concepts is useful, or if I should just work with them. We will see. 

1. `stats.pdf`: This has a few statistical concepts I'm shaky on and want ot explain better. These might turn into blog posts.
