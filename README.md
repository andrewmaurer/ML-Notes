# ML Notes

Here I have some notes I've taken on various topics in machine learning and related fields. There are four documents:

1. `SQL`: Notes on SQL

1. `econometrics`: I'd heard that econometrics answers some time-series questions that ML is currently incapable of answering. This is where I will collect notes on that research.

1. `notes`: Mainly my machine learning proper notes.

1. `python`: things I should know about python.

1. `stats`: statistics notes
