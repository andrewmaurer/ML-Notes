\section{Principal Component Analysis}

\subsection{Overview and Key Points} Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised algorithm which performs dimensionality reduction on numerical variables. This is very similar to singular value decomposition of linear algebra.

Essentially we take an orthogonal transformation $F: \RR^n \to \RR^n$  such that
