\label{sec:rf-overview}

Random forests are an \emph{ensemble learning method} which employs \emph{bagging}. The idea is to build many high-variance, low-bias decision trees and average (or vote on) the results to reduce variance. The individual trees are constructed so that each tree captures different predictive power, because ensemble techniques work best when
