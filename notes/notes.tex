\begin{abstract}
  The goal of this document is to present my own own understanding of machine learning models from a somewhat theoretical standpoint. I want to describe the models rigorously and mathematically, as well as point out some key difference between models which seem similar. For a more applied view, I will have a Github repo dedicated to Python examples of these algorithms, which may be my own implementation in \texttt{numpy} or simply using pre-existing libraries (e.g., \texttt{sklearn} or \texttt{pytorch}) on publicly available data-sets to get a feel for the techniques. At some point I may take one or more of these sections and make it into its own document, or make this document into a book. That's a problem for another day. :)
